# Hello, world! - Intro to Golang

## Overview

The go programming language is well known for it's simplicity, speed, and novel approach to handling concurrency.

In this lab we will walk through some of the key language features that make go unique and give you hands on experience working with them.

This lab is divided into 10 sections, each one covering a different area of the language.

In most sections, rather than writing a complete program, we will be exploring the language by writing code in a unit-test harness.

This will allow us to quickly explore different language features in a clean and simple way.
