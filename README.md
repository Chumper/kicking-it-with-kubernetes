2. [Go Webservices](2-helloweb/README.md)
3. [Using gRPC](3-hellogrpc/README.md)

5. [Kubernetes FTW - Deploy and configure services with K8s](5-hellok8s/README.md)
6. [Skaffold - Greasing the wheels of K8s development](6-helloskaffold/README.md)

We will be working through the lab material together, but you can feel free to work ahead if are already familiar with a topic.

If you get stuck, a finished version of each lab step is provided for your reference.
